# Basic Flow Prototype 

## Purpose
The main purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate a simple layout and flow for the Learning@Scale data dictionary platform. Opening the index.html file in this directory will open a low-fidelity prototype of the web page with some basic interactable features that will be explained here.

## Features And Flow

The flow of this prototype involves the simple case where a researcher wants to get more information on the five foundation elements of the Learning@Scale database. The researcher will start on the Learning@Scale overview page when they first open the web application. The researcher can then click on the five foundational data tables drop box in the contents column on the left side of the page. This will drop down the five elements that they can also click on for more information. At any point they can minimize or maximize the contents column by clicking on the <> icons on the top of the contents column. The researcher can also return to the overview page at any time by pressing the Learning@Scale overview button on the contents column. 

Features in the prototype include:

- Minimizing or maximizing the contents column at any point by pressing the <> icons on the top of the column.
- Can click on the five foundational tables drop box to get more options and information on those elements.
- Can click on any of the five foundational elements for more information (Student Profile, Student Trajectory, Course Profile, Discussion Board, Written Assignments) 
- Can return to the overview page at any time by pressing the Learning@Scale Overview button on the contents column at any point.

## Additional Info

- Included in the directory is the index.html file that can be used to view and interact with the prototype
- The raw pencil.io file is also included in the directory if you ever need to edit it further or export any elements as other file types.
- All the pages are also included as png files
